This digital "Etch-A-Sketch" marks my first honest attempt at using DOM manipulation. As such, it gave me a great opportunity to practice basic DOM methods, a few different types of event listeners, and a fresh slew of increasingly complicated functions.

The trickiest part was designing a variable set of divs that could grow or shrink to fill a container (or sketchpad) of a fixed size.

Just for fun, I also added the abilty to draw in randomly generated color values. Happy sketching!

Feb. 2026 Update:

Just for practice, I completely overhauled the old code and UI to fix the issues I had with the original program.

More specifically, I simplified and cleaned up the JavaScript, swapped out the cumbersome (and very buggy) functions that handled the generation of new sketchpads, did away with the random color feature, and updated the UI for a more polished final product.
